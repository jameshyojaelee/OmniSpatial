# OmniSpatial Documentation

Welcome to the OmniSpatial documentation site. The project provides tooling to convert spatial omics data sets into interoperable OME-NGFF Zarr stores and SpatialData bundles.

## Components

- **CLI** – Rich Typer-powered interface for conversion, validation, and viewer guidance.
- **Converters** – Adapter registry that can be extended for vendor-specific pipelines.
- **Validators** – JSON Schema-driven checks over the generated NGFF hierarchies.
- **Viewers** – Napari plugin and a Next.js web viewer built with @vivjs.

Refer to the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) to dive into usage right away.
